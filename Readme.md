# Rss2JiraInspired by [rss2email](http://www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), and [Zapier](https://zapier.com). These tools didn't meet my needs. Rss2email wasn't able to set all the fields in JIRA, IFTTT doesn't have JIRA support, and Zapier costs money. This is a PowerShell module with cmdlets for adding, managing, updating RSS feeds. There is also a basic script intended to run as a Scheduled Task. The combination of the Windows Task Scheduler, the rss2jira module, PSSQLite, PSJira, and my script allows for JIRA issues to be created when a new item is added to one of the monitored RSS feeds.  My main use of this was to monitor Citrix's RSS feeds for new releases and create JIRA issues for evaluating, testing, and deploying the new product versions. ## Getting StartedThere isn't anything here yet. ### PrerequisitesWhat things you need to install the software and how to install them* PowerShell 5* PSSQLite Module* PSJira Module* Configuring the PSJira Module### InstallingA step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env runningSay what the step will be```Give the example```And repeat```until finished```End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo## Running the testsExplain how to run the automated tests for this system### Break down into end to end testsExplain what these tests test and why```Give an example```### And coding style testsExplain what these tests test and why```Give an example```## DeploymentAdd additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system## Built With## Contributing## Versioning## Authors* **Andrew Zbikowski** - *Initial work* - [andyzib](https://github.com/andyzib)See also the list of [contributors](https://github.com/your/project/contributors) who participated in this project.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details## Acknowledgments* Hat tip to anyone who's code was used* Inspiration* etc
